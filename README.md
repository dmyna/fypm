Agility, priority, measurement and consistency. These are the words that define fypm, your new and definitive task manager. Or better yet: your productivity manager. Forget about magic formulas, empty promises or anything else that promises more than it delivers.

- Agility: you don't want to have to finish a list of tasks, one by one. With the power of computing and well-written code, you will make the machine work for you, never the other way around.
- Priority: you don't have to choose what to do first, you have to choose what **NOT** to do. With fypm, you will be 10 steps ahead. Enjoy a rich and constantly improving system that doesn't care about where, how or why you work, but rather about what you **SHOULD** do.
- Measurement: get it right, get it wrong, get it right, get it wrong. Write it all down and repeat it again. Receive extensive and related reports on what you did and should be doing, avoid unpleasant surprises. Once written down, never lose it again.
- Consistency: do, do, do. Time is not your enemy, but your best friend. Put together good practices, balance things out, and look for the good old long term. Just do it.

This app is not and will not be just another one, because it is as used as it was designed. Its purpose is not only to meet the needs of its creator, but to become something for humanity. Because we humans create needs that our brains were not able to support, so nothing is more fair than a solution that seeks to take care of this. Don't store things in your brain, use it for what it does best: create ideas.

## Documentation
All documentation related to how to use or contribute is on the [wiki](https://github.com/dmyna/fypm/wiki) and is being detailed little by little (as the dev has time...). Please open an issue if what you need is not there!

## Roadmap
By code maintainer's habit, all problems and plans are naturally written in issues, pull requests, documentation and milestones. So here is a brief summary of the next version plans:
- Separate the logic of calling taskwarrior from the CLI application to an API.
- Implement the main CLI features in the frontend (tauri).
- Move all existing documentation to the wiki.


This app takes the idea of ​​continuous improvement seriously. The developer who maintains it does his best to keep it improving, so please contribute what you can :) <3
